{"name":"Content-guide","tagline":"Copyright Content Guide","body":"## 18F Content Guide\r\n\r\nThis guide helps writers create content that’s easy to use and meets citizens where they’re at. Government websites often talk at readers rather than to them: As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.\r\n\r\nThis guide takes into account that frustration as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web. Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the content design process, and engender trust by communicating in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\n## How to use this guide\r\n\r\nWe created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.
